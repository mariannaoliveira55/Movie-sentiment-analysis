# Movie-sentiment-analysis
This project aims to apply the tools learned in the Text Mining course to perform sentiment analysis on reviews from the IMDb website.
Using a dataset that includes natural language reviews and their corresponding sentiment (positive or negative), machine learning models were trained to classify sentiment.
Then, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) was used to extract latent topics from the reviews.
The goal was to group the reviews by topic and observe how sentiment varies across them, making the project relevant for studying movie consumer preferences.
